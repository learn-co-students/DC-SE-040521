# React Props

## Thinking in React

- Planning and drawing boxes around everything
- Component Hierarchy/Tree
- Build Static Components
- Project structure?

## Functional Components

- take in props as its parameter
- return JSX of what this component should look like

## Class Components

- extends React.Component
- needs a render instance method
  - return some JSX

## Props

- a JS object
- Props are passed to other components and can only flow down (passed from parent)
- What does the props object look like?
- Like parameters to the function
- Props are read only

## Object Destructuring
